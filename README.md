## Project Background
Diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, represents a critical public health challenge in the United States, affecting millions of individuals and creating a substantial economic burden. As a chronic condition characterized by the body's inability to effectively regulate blood glucose levels, diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease. The early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This project leverages the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to develop predictive models that accurately identify individuals at risk for diabetes, thereby aiding in early intervention and management.

## Technical Background
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes using the BRFSS 2015 dataset. This dataset contains responses from over 253,000 individuals and 21 feature variables that capture various health indicators and risk factors associated with diabetes. Given the prevalence of diabetes and the importance of early detection, this project aims to identify significant predictors and create a reliable predictive model.

Goals vs Non-Goals:

Write a bulleted list of (3-5 points each) of goals and non-goals. This should help the reader understand the context that would factor into solution selections and trade-offs. Goals will help the reader understand what a successful outcome looks like. Non-goals will help limit the scope of your project and prevent scope creep.

Goals
•	Accurate Prediction of Diabetes Risk: Using the BRFSS 2015 dataset, develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the risk of type 2 diabetes, focusing on achieving high precision, recall, and F1 scores.
•	Identification of Key Risk Factors: Identify and validate the most significant predictors of diabetes risk, such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and blood pressure, to provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals.
•	Model Interpretability: Ensure the model is interpretable by healthcare professionals, allowing for easy understanding and trust in its predictions.
•	Comprehensive Evaluation: To enhance the model's practical utility in early diabetes detection, use standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and consider business use cases such as reducing false negatives.
•	Scalable Data Preparation and Processing: Implement scalable data preparation and processing techniques to handle large datasets efficiently, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature scaling.
Non-Goals
•	Cure or Directly Treat Diabetes: The project will not aim to develop a cure or direct treatment for diabetes but rather to predict the risk and assist in early detection.
•	Real-Time Prediction Deployment: The project will not focus on deploying the model for real-time predictions in clinical settings but rather on developing and validating a robust predictive model.
•	Extensive Data Collection: The project will not involve collecting new data or extending the dataset beyond the BRFSS 2015 dataset; it will solely use the existing dataset for model development.
•	Predictive Modeling for All Types of Diabetes: The focus will be on type 2 diabetes risk prediction and not on other types of diabetes, such as type 1 or gestational diabetes.
•	Integration with Healthcare Systems: The project will not include integrating the predictive model into existing healthcare IT systems or electronic health records (EHRs), but it will provide the foundation for such future integrations.
