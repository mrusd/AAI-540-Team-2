Diabetes Detection


Project Scope

Project Background: 

Diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, represents a critical public health challenge in the United States, affecting millions of individuals and creating a substantial economic burden. As a chronic condition characterized by the body's inability to effectively regulate blood glucose levels, diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease. The early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This project leverages the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to develop predictive models that accurately identify individuals at risk for diabetes, thereby aiding in early intervention and management.
